# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a responsive and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a sleek design with light and dark themes that can be toggled by the user. Players alternate turns to place "X" and "O" on the grid, and the game automatically checks for a winner or a draw after each move.  

## Key Features:
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Automatically switches turns between "X" and "O."
- **Winner Detection:** Highlights the winner and disables the grid after the game ends.
- **Reset Functionality:** Allows players to restart the game with a single click.
- **Theme Toggle:** Switch between light and dark modes for a customized experience.

This project demonstrates basic game logic implementation and DOM manipulation, making it a great beginner-level project for web development.
